### 1-1
> Show that `a + b` can be less than `min(a,b)`

If we take negative values, such as `a =-1, b=-2`,
then `min(a,b) = -2` and `a+b = -3`.
### 1-2
>Show that `a x b` can be less than `min(a,b)`

If one value is `0` and the other negative such as `a=-1, b=0` then `min(a,b) = -1` but the product is `0`.

### 1-3
> Design/draw a road network with two points `a` and `b` such that the fastest route between `a` and `b` is not the shorted route

### 1-4
> Design/draw a road network with two points `a` and `b` such that the shortest route between $a$ and `b` is not the route with the fewest turns
